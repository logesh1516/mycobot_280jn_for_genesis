## Overview

The MyCobot 280 JN is a 6-DOF lightweight collaborative robot arm. This repository includes its URDF representation and corresponding mesh files, tailored for simulation in the GENESIS simulator environment and other compatible simulators.
You can use this model for robotics research, teaching, simulation, or integration into broader automation systems.

## Features

- Complete URDF definition (`mycobot_280_jn.urdf`) including links, joints, visuals & collisions.  
- Mesh assets (in `meshes/` folder) for accurate geometry and rendering.  
- Simplified model oriented for simulation use, ensuring compatibility in GENESIS (and potentially other platforms).  
- Structure that allows extension (e.g., adding sensors, grippers, control interfaces).
